   <h2><p>As an artist, believe in every art form, since there are multiple ways of expressing what matters and what is important. An important aspect of the artwork is to showcase a meaningful yet playful way in ceramics. An important aspect of my artwork is to showcase a meaningful yet playful way in ceramics. As long as I can remember, I became interested in art. Began drawing a young age. During my junior year in high school, began experimenting with other mediums such as clay, paper, acrylics, oils, pastel, and so on; however, there was a tie between painting and sculpture. Since I enjoyed using both oils and clay mediums decided to combine them in a somewhat conventional way. 
From time to time, I do meddle in other mediums, since there are so many other creative ways to express what is important as an artist. Wildlife conservation has always been important to me since childhood, considering this was my upbringing. I was born in Costa Rica and since my childhood, I was always exposed to a tropical atmosphere were nature and its wildlife are the main focus; coming from a country that is protected approximately 28% of its land, wildlife, and national parks. There is a natural sustainability that cannot be duplicated and only nature and its wildlife can offer this beautiful symbiotic relationship that cannot only improve the quality of life for the planet, but also for all of its habitants.     
During my travels, I have had the opportunity of seeing wildlife in a much deeper exposure as each creature flourish in their natural habitat. This exposure, brought a clear sense of the importance of wildlife conservation and animal habitation. This is one of the reasons why I chose to use wildlife as my inspiration.
